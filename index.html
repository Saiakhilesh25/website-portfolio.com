									<h2>PLAGIARISM DETECTION IN ONLINE EXAMS</h2>

										exam and obtain high scores through unorthodox methods, and it is also possible to
										detect unethical examinees. So, various data enthusiasts have used different approaches to
										detect them: some used camera video data for face patterns, others use computer
										display video data for anomaly detection, and so on.</p>

									<h3>SPARKS FOUNDATION</h3>
									<p>As a Data science and business Analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation. I worked on a project where I predicted student percentages based on their study hours, I have used supervised learning as the goal was to forecast rather than identify insightful trends. For regression analysis, I harnessed the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, then divided the data to train and test with each model. Finally, I evaluated and plotted the prediction and Uploaded the repositories to <a href = "https://github.com/Saiakhilesh25/Sparks-Foundation/blob/main/task1.py">Github.</a>The <a href ="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lgryd3M4qeHvKXtGyrYkCcbsYxEGU0HC/view?usp=sharing">Internship</a> helped me to sharpen my programming skills and gain real-world experience.</p>
